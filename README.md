Vision-Verse-EEA:

I completed this project under the Electrical Engineering Association, IIT Kanpur, under the mentorship of 3 mentors from the department.
This project provided me with a comprehensive learning experience, combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on projects to solidify my understanding. 
I got to learn fundamental concepts like image representation (pixels, color models), image enhancement (denoising, filtering), image manipulation (resizing, cropping), and image analysis (feature extraction, segmentation).
